CASE MANIPULATION FUNCTION:

rules:
* sql language (table_name,coln_anme,clause/stmt,operator_name) is not a case sensective 
  only the value present in a table is case sensective.
* whenever we are wring query by loohking into table struct 
  we should write query not by looking into values present in table

 3 types:

1) UPEER(): use to convert given string in uppercase.

syntax:
	upper('string'/c.n)

2) LOWER(): use to convert given string in lowercase.

syntax:
	lower('string'/c.n)

3) INITCAP(): use to convert given string in initcapcase(initial letter capital).

syntax:
	initcap('string'/c.n)


WHEN TO GO CASE MANIPULATION FUNCTION:
	
	we are writing string/char litteral in where clause
	
 	what type of case manipulation fuction in LHS side same type of value as RHS side


OPERATORS:

* we want to write multiple cond in where clause 
* will exceute multiple cond in single record at one shot

5 TYPES:

1) Arithmetic operator ---> +,-,*,/
2) Concadination operator ---> ||
3) Relational operator ---> <,>,<=,>=,=,!=
4) Special operator ---> IN,BETWEEN,LIKE,IS
5) Logical operator ---> AND,OR,NOT

Concadination operator ||
* Combing,merging multiple string into single string

Syntax:
	'string1'/c.n1 || 'string2'/c.n2

LOGICAL OPERATOR:

3 logical operator:

1)AND
2)OR
3)NOT



1)AND:

when the given cond's are mandatory to execute then we should go AND operator

case1:
 1) if cond1 is TRUE the o/p of AND operator is depending on cond2
 2) if cond1 is true o/p is true.
    if cond2 is false the o/p is false.
case2:
 1) if cond1 is false whatever it might be cond2 the o/p AND operator should become false


 2)OR:

 when either of the conditions are mandatory to execute then go OR operator

case1:
 1) if cond1 is FALSE whatever it might be cond2 the o/p OR operator should become TRUE
case2:
 1) if cond1 is FALSE the o/p of OR operator is depending on cond2
 2) if cond2 is true o/p is true else
    if cond2 is false the o/p is false.
