SPECIAL OPERATOR:

4 TYPES:

1)IN	2)BETWEEN    3)LIKE	4)IS	

1)IN Operator:

* column name is same values are different

IN Operator:

* Multi value Operator
* accept single value in LHS side and multi value in RHS side
* will perform equalto comparaison
* will compare single LHS valuse with all present in RHS side
* it will return true if any one of the cond/comparaison is true
* it will return false if all the cond/comparaison is false
* working similar to OR operator

Syntax:
	where c.n/expr IN (val1,val2,val3...);

2)BETWEEN Operator:

* when the input is in form of range

BETWEEN Operator: 

* written as  >= lowerlimit and  <= upper limit
* always lower limt < upper limit
* BETWEEN operator working as inclusive range(lower limit value to upper limit value)
* it will return true when all the cond/coparaison is true
* it will return false if any one of the cond/comparaison is false
* working similar to AND operator

Syntax:
	where c.n/expr BETWEEN lower value and upper value;
